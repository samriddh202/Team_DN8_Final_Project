⚙️ Operations Analyst DIVE Analysis - NBA Player Value ⏱️
Author: Carlo R.
Project: NBA Player Performance vs. Salary Analysis (2022-2023 Season)

1. Core Objective 🎯
This analysis focuses on operational efficiency: aligning player minutes and salary with their actual on-court value. The goal is to ensure that every minute played and every dollar spent contributes effectively to winning. We're not just spotting mismatches; we're turning those insights into actionable rotation changes that can improve the team's performance this week.

This analysis uses the same shared data and custom metrics as the rest of the team to ensure our final strategy is perfectly in sync! 🤝

2. Our Game Plan: The DIVE Framework 🗺️
Our analysis follows a four-step game plan to optimize the team's on-court operations:

Discover: 🧐 Get a clear picture of how salary and court time line up with what players actually produce, spotting where expectations and reality don't match.

Investigate: 🕵️‍♂️ Dig deeper into why some players are undervalued or overpaid, focusing on where high-value players are being underutilized and where low-value players are getting too many minutes.

Validate: ✅ Stress-test our proposed rotation changes against real-world scenarios (like smaller minute budgets or key player absences) to ensure the plan is resilient.

Extend: 🚀 Turn our validated insights into a simple, low-risk action plan that a coaching staff can implement immediately to see a measurable lift in performance.

3. Key Findings & Insights 📊
Discover: Spotting the Mismatches
Clear Quadrants: The player pool is clearly divided into four groups:

Elite Value (150 players): Low salary, high performance. 💎

Overpaid (160 players): High salary, low performance. 🚩

Bang-for-the-Buck All-Stars: Players like Desmond Bane (MEM) deliver massive value for their contracts.

Rotation Rethinks: Players like Joe Harris (BRK) have a large negative Value Gap, signaling that their role and minutes need to be re-evaluated.

Investigate: Finding the Leaks
What the Market Rewards: Our models show that salary is most influenced by volume stats (like points and minutes), but our Performance Score is driven by broader impact (efficiency, defense, playmaking). This gap is where value is lost.

The Bottleneck: We identified 274 high-value players getting low minutes and 272 low-value players getting high minutes. This is the primary operational inefficiency.

The Biggest Opportunity: Our analysis projected that the Portland Trail Blazers (POR) have the single largest potential performance gain from simple minute reallocation.

Validate: Stress-Testing the Plan
The Recommendation Holds Up: We tested our proposed minute reallocations for the New Orleans Pelicans (NOP) under several stress scenarios:

Budget Changes: The performance lift remained positive and meaningful whether we reallocated 6, 9, 12, or 15 minutes.

Key Player Unavailable: Even when we removed their most undervalued player (Jose Alvarado), the plan still resulted in a significant positive gain.

Minute Constraints: Tighter or looser minute caps for individual players changed the exact number, but the positive direction of the result never changed.

Conclusion: The strategy is resilient and not dependent on perfect conditions.

4. Strategic Recommendations 🏆
Based on our findings, here's the playbook for optimizing on-court operations:

Implement Targeted, Low-Risk Minute Reallocations: This isn't about a complete overhaul. The strategy is to shift a small budget of 6-12 minutes per game from the least efficient players to the most efficient players within the same position group.

Example: For the Pelicans, this simple shift projects a gain of +103.02 Performance Score units per game.

Focus on the "Value Gap" for Quick Wins: Use the Value Gap metric as your primary guide.

Give More Minutes To: Players with a large positive Value Gap (e.g., Desmond Bane, Austin Reaves, Tre Jones).

Reduce Minutes For: Players with a large negative Value Gap (e.g., Joe Harris, Nicolas Batum, Terrence Ross).

Adopt a Rapid Test-and-Learn Cycle: Treat rotation changes like a fast experiment.

Pilot: Implement the new rotation for 5-7 games.

Evaluate: Track weekly changes in team performance.

Lock or Revert: If the change works, lock it in. If not, revert to the old rotation. This creates a low-risk, high-reward operational cadence.

Align Operations with Scouting and Contracts:

Scouting: Focus on recruiting players who contribute across the board, not just volume scorers.

Contracts: Use this operational data to inform contract decisions. Prioritize extending players who are consistently efficient, and look to move on from players who are persistent operational drains.
