📈 Customer & Market Analyst DIVE Analysis - NBA Player Value 🛒
Author: David Jetter
Project: NBA Player Performance vs. Salary Analysis (2022-2023 Season)

1. Core Objective 🎯
This analysis treats NBA players as "customers" and their contracts as "purchases" to uncover deep market insights. The main goal is to segment the player market, understand what drives player value, and create a data-driven strategy for smarter player acquisition and retention.

This analysis uses the same shared data and custom metrics as the rest of the team to ensure our final strategy is perfectly in sync! 🤝

2. Our Game Plan: The DIVE Framework 🗺️
Our analysis follows a four-step game plan to understand the player market:

Discover: 🧐 Get a first look at the market's structure, identifying key "customer" segments based on age, position, and awards.

Investigate: 🕵️‍♂️ Dig deeper to find the most valuable players (our "best customers") and analyze the key behaviors and stats that drive their value.

Validate: ✅ Use statistical tests and predictive models to confirm our theories about player value and market behavior.

Extend: 🚀 Turn our validated insights into a clear playbook for acquiring new talent and retaining our most valuable players.

3. Key Findings & Insights 📊
Discover: The Lay of the Land
Key Market Segments: The NBA player market can be broken down into clear segments:

Premium Segment 👑: Centers & Power Forwards who command the highest average salaries.

Volume Segment 🏃‍♂️: Guards, who make up the largest portion of the league.

Elite Segment 🏆: A small group of award-winners who earn a significant salary premium.

Prime Time: The core of the league's talent is concentrated in the 25-30 age range.

Investigate: Finding the Best Deals
Most Valuable Customers: The best bargains are found in the "Rising Star" segment (ages 23-26). These players often deliver elite performance on cost-controlled contracts, offering the best return on investment.

What Drives Value?: Minutes Per Game is a huge factor. The market clearly rewards players who are durable and have a consistent role on the team.

Award Impact: While award winners get a big paycheck, our VALUE_SCORE shows that there are often better bargains to be found among non-award winners.

Validate: Checking Our Work
Market Predictability: We built a Random Forest model that can predict a player's salary with high accuracy (R² of 0.656).

What Gets You Paid? 💸: The model confirmed that Age, PER (Player Efficiency Rating), and Minutes Per Game are the most important factors in determining a player's salary.

Career Arc Confirmed: The data validates a clear career curve where both performance and salary peak in a player's late 20s.

4. Strategic Recommendations 🏆
Based on our findings, here's the playbook for winning the talent war:

Target the "Rising Star" Segment: Focus acquisition efforts on players aged 23-26. This is the optimal window to acquire talent before their value is fully recognized by the market, locking in high performance at a lower cost.

Create a "Retention Priority" Matrix: Don't treat all players the same. Categorize them to focus your efforts:

Critical Priority: Prime-age (27-30) stars with a PER over 20. Lock them up.

High Priority: Young players (under 26) with a PER over 18. Extend them early.

Develop an "Acquisition Score": Don't just look at one stat. Use a blended score that combines value, future potential, age, and performance to identify the absolute best players to target in free agency and trades.

Map the Market Opportunity: Use our "Value Score Heat Map" to find undervalued players by position and age. For example, the data shows that finding a high-value "Rising Star" Guard is a huge market inefficiency and a major strategic opportunity.
